rating_history_gui.py is a graphical tool that allows users to see a graph of their Supreme Commander online rating history.  
rating_history_matplotlib.py and rating_history_plotly.py provide various graphs of data downloaded from the api.faforever.com database.  
analytics_factions.py retrieves data on Williamson's Bridge matches: the faction, mean, and deviation of both players. It then makes a hypothesis as to which faction provides an advantage on this map.    
analytics_games.py is a short script for printing out the most recent games of mine and displaying rating deltas, dates/times, etc.    

Here are the plotted graphs that were created with this project:
