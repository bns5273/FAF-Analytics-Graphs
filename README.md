rating_history_gui.py is a graphical tool that allows users to see a graph of their Supreme Commander online rating history.  
rating_history_matplotlib.py and rating_history_plotly.py provide various graphs of data downloaded from the api.faforever.com database.  
analytics_factions.py retrieves data on Williamson's Bridge matches: the faction, mean, and deviation of both players. It then makes a hypothesis as to which faction provides an advantage on this map.    
analytics_games.py is a short script for printing out the most recent games of mine and displaying rating deltas, dates/times, etc.    
analytics_leaderboards.py is another small script that I used to create some other interesting graphs the the database. I compare the ratings of players over the experience they have with the game, as well as plot their performance in different game modes.

Here are the plotted graphs that were created with this project:  
https://plot.ly/~bsse/12  (my rating over time)  
https://plot.ly/~bsse/14  (my rating over games)  
https://plot.ly/~bsse/33  (my rating over wins)  
https://plot.ly/~bsse/35  (my rating over losses)  

https://plot.ly/~bsse/23  (ladder rating over global rating)  
https://plot.ly/~bsse/25  (global rating over games played)  
https://plot.ly/~bsse/27  (ladder rating over games played)
